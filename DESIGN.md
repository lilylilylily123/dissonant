# Design System: dissonant

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The 4-Track Terminal"**

A dark, monospace instrument with tape-grit soul. Four worlds fuse here: the tactile,
playful-but-serious precision of a Teenage Engineering OP-1; the dense, numbers-everywhere
legibility of music trackers (Renoise, FastTracker); the lo-fi analog warmth of cassette
4-track and zine culture; and the unembellished honesty of terminal and brutalist software.
The result is a tool that respects the user enough to show real musical structure plainly,
then makes it readable — never a toy, never a dashboard.

The surface is committed dark, the way a DAW used in a dim room should be, with a single
characterful brand color carrying identity and one purpose-built palette for the note-tier
system layered on top. Density is welcome; it's made legible through guidance and labeling,
not stripped out. Grit is a feature — subtle texture, honest monospace, tape-deck restraint —
not decoration bolted on. Every pixel should feel like it was placed by someone who loves
this music.

This system explicitly rejects three things, carried verbatim from the product's
anti-references: the **childish toy** (candy buttons, cartoon mascots, confetti), the
**generic SaaS dashboard** (cards-on-grey, corporate blue, Inter-everything), and the
**sterile/clinical** (cold all-white, over-minimal Apple-stock neutrality). Pro-tool *depth*
is not rejected — depth made legible is the whole point.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Committed dark surface; one characterful brand color, not corporate blue.
- Mono-forward typography — the tool reads like an instrument, not a web app.
- The three-tier note system is the signature element and must read by shape + label, not color alone.
- Responsive motion that conveys state (playhead, recoloring tiers), never choreography.
- Honest density: tracker-grade information, made legible by guidance.

## 2. Colors

Committed-dark strategy: a near-black architectural base, one saturated and slightly-off
brand color doing real identity work, and a dedicated, accessibility-first palette for the
three note-tiers. The mood lives in the brand color and the grit, not in a tinted-grey wash.

### Primary
- **Brand Signal** (`oklch` value `[to be resolved during implementation]`): the single
  characterful brand hue — leaning toward a saturated, lightly-aged tone with CRT/tape-deck-LED
  character (amber-phosphor or acid-tinged territory), deliberately *not* corporate blue. Carries
  logo, primary actions, current selection, the locked-key indicator. Chroma capped so text stays
  readable; white/near-white text on any filled instance.

### Neutral
- **Tape Black** (`[to resolve]`, OKLCH L ~0.10–0.14, near-zero chroma or a hair toward the brand hue):
  the main working surface — the dim room the music happens in.
- **Deck Panel** (`[to resolve]`, base pulled ~10–15% toward ink): a second neutral layer for
  toolbars, the chord-track lane, side panels — slightly distinct from the content surface.
- **Print Ink** (`[to resolve]`, ≥7:1 vs surface): primary text/note glyphs, carrying a trace of
  the brand hue at low chroma.
- **Faded Label** (`[to resolve]`, ≥3.5:1 vs surface): secondary text, inactive labels, gridlines.

### The Note-Tier Palette (signature; accessibility-first)
The three tiers are the product. They get distinct, color-blind-safe hues AND a non-color cue each:
- **Solid (chord tone):** the "rock-solid" tier — a confident, filled treatment. `[hue to resolve]`.
- **Tension (spicy-but-good):** the "use-with-intent" tier — a warmer/amber signal, distinct shape
  or partial fill. `[hue to resolve]`.
- **Dissonance (flagged):** the "going-wrong-on-purpose" tier — a hot warning hue PLUS a
  hatch/stripe/flag mark so it never relies on color. Labeled, never disabled. `[hue to resolve]`.

### Named Rules
**The Three-Tier Doctrine.** The note-tier system NEVER communicates by color alone. Every tier
carries a second channel — shape, fill pattern, border, or label — so red-green color blindness
(~8% of men) and small sizes never break the core mechanic. This rule is non-negotiable; it is the
product, not a polish item.

**The One-Signal Rule.** The brand color marks identity, the current selection, and the locked key —
nothing decorative. Its restraint is what makes the locked-key moment land.

## 3. Typography

**Display/UI Font:** Monospace `[specific family to be chosen at implementation]` — a characterful
mono with real personality (think the lineage of typewriter/terminal faces, not a sterile coding font).
**Body Font:** the same mono family carries the UI; prose-heavy help text may use a single quiet
companion sans `[to resolve]` if mono fatigues at length.
**Numeric/Data:** mono, always — note names, chord symbols, timecodes, tempo, beat positions.

**Character:** Mono-forward and proud of it. The fixed grid of a monospace face *is* the tracker
heritage and the terminal honesty in one move; it makes numbers and note-data line up perfectly and
gives the whole tool the feel of an instrument rather than a SaaS product.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (mono, heavy weight, fixed rem — not fluid): the wordmark, big chord names, the
  key-lock moment. Used sparingly for character.
- **Headline** (mono, medium-bold): panel/section titles.
- **Title** (mono, medium): track names, dialog titles.
- **Body** (mono or companion sans, regular, ~14–15px, 65–75ch for prose): help text, descriptions.
- **Label/Data** (mono, smaller, slightly tightened): note names, chord symbols, numeric readouts,
  the "notes you could play now" list.

### Named Rules
**The Fixed-Scale Rule.** Type uses a fixed rem scale (ratio ~1.125–1.2), never fluid `clamp()`.
This is a tool viewed at consistent DPI; a heading that shrinks inside a side panel looks broken,
not responsive.

## 4. Elevation

Mostly flat, with tonal layering — depth comes from the near-black surface stepping to the slightly
lighter panel layer, not from drop shadows. Responsive motion energy means shadows, when they appear,
are a *response to state* (a dragged note lifting, a focused field), never ambient decoration. The
aesthetic is tape-deck and terminal: physical-feeling but flat, with grit and contrast doing the work
shadows would do elsewhere.

### Named Rules
**The Flat-Deck Rule.** Surfaces are flat at rest. Any shadow or lift is a state response (hover,
drag, focus) and disappears when the state ends.

## 5. Components

Component specs land on the first scan-mode rerun (once SwiftUI exists). One signature pattern is
seeded now because it's the core mechanic:

### The Note Tier (signature, pre-implementation doctrine)
A note in the piano roll renders its tier through **two channels at once**: a tier color AND a tier
shape/fill/mark. Solid = full confident fill; Tension = partial fill or distinct outline; Dissonance =
hot color plus a hatch/stripe and a small flag affordance. The note stays fully draggable and playable
in every tier — tiering is information, never a gate. The same tier vocabulary appears in the "notes you
could play now" readout so the two surfaces always agree.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** commit to the dark surface and let one characterful brand color carry identity.
- **Do** give every note-tier a non-color cue (shape, pattern, border, or label) — always.
- **Do** keep numbers, note names, and chord symbols in monospace so data lines up.
- **Do** make density legible through guidance and labeling; pro-tool depth is welcome.
- **Do** use motion to convey state (playhead, recoloring tiers, flag reactions) at 150–250ms.

### Don't:
- **Don't** build the **childish toy** — no candy buttons, cartoon mascots, rounded-everything, confetti.
- **Don't** build the **generic SaaS dashboard** — no cards-on-grey, no corporate blue, no Inter-everywhere.
- **Don't** go **sterile/clinical** — no cold all-white, over-minimal Apple-stock neutrality.
- **Don't** ever signal a note-tier by color alone (the Three-Tier Doctrine).
- **Don't** disable, block, or auto-correct a "wrong" note — label it and let it be chosen.
- **Don't** use fluid `clamp()` type or orchestrated load animations; this is a tool, not a landing page.
